# NovelVerse - Translation Prototype

This project is an initial prototype for the translation feature of the NovelVerse web application.
It uses the Google Gemini API to:

1. Analyze characters from an original text.
2. Suggest culturally appropriate Indian vernacular names for these characters.
3. Translate the original text into a selected Indian language, applying the chosen name mappings.
